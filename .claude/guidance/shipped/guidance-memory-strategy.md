# Guidance & Memory Tuning Strategy

**Purpose:** How to build and tune a RAG-based guidance system using moflo's semantic search, embedding pipeline, and indexing. Reference when creating guidance documents, troubleshooting search quality, or extending the system.

---

## Problem Statement

Claude Code agents need project-specific knowledge — coding rules, architecture patterns, entity templates, testing conventions — delivered at the right moment. Without a retrieval system, agents either miss critical rules or require massive CLAUDE.md files that waste context window tokens.

**Goals:**
- Agents find relevant guidance automatically via semantic search
- Subagents spawned by the coordinator inherit memory access
- Search quality is high enough that agents don't need to read whole files
- The system survives `npm install` (indexing runs on session start)

---

## Architecture

Three layers: embedding generation, vector storage, and search.

```
Source Files (.claude/guidance/*.md, docs/*.md)
         |
         v
index-guidance.mjs --- Chunk on ## headers, build RAG links
         |                (prev/next, siblings, parent/child, context overlap)
         v
.swarm/memory.db ----- SQLite (entries + metadata + embedding vectors)
         |
         v
build-embeddings.mjs - Generate 384-dim vectors per entry
         |                (Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 neural, or domain-aware hash fallback)
         v
RuVector (@ruvector/core) -- HNSW index infrastructure
         v
Search layer ---------- Three access paths:
                          1. MCP tools (mcp__claude-flow__memory_search) -- preferred
                          2. CLI (npx flo memory search) -- fallback
                          3. Script (semantic-search.mjs) -- detailed output
```

**Key files:**

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `.claude/guidance/*.md` | Guidance documents (source of truth) |
| `bin/index-guidance.mjs` | Chunks documents, stores in SQLite with RAG metadata |
| `bin/build-embeddings.mjs` | Generates vector embeddings (neural or hash) |
| `.swarm/memory.db` | SQLite database with entries, metadata, embeddings |
| `@ruvector/core` | HNSW vector index, WASM fallback, SIMD operations |

---

## Guidance Document Optimization Rules

These rules determine how well your guidance documents retrieve via semantic search:

### 1. Every file needs a Purpose line

Add `**Purpose:**` as the first meaningful line after the title. Claude checks this first for relevance scoring. Without it, the chunk has no summary signal.

### 2. H2 headings are the primary retrieval signal

The indexer splits on `##`. Each heading becomes the chunk title, prepended to searchable content. Domain-specific keywords in headings dramatically improve recall.

**Bad:** `## Overview`, `## Rules`, `## Pattern`
**Good:** `## Soft Delete Rules`, `## JWT Authentication Pattern`, `## Database Entity Migration`

### 3. Ideal chunk size: 1000-4000 characters

Below 50 chars the chunk is dropped. Above 6000 the indexer force-splits on paragraphs, which breaks mid-thought. The sweet spot produces focused embeddings.

### 4. Self-contained chunks

Each H2 section must answer a question without needing the rest of the document. Include: the rule, a code example, and a cross-reference.

### 5. Tables over prose

Claude parses structured data more accurately than paragraphs. DO/DON'T tables, field reference tables, and command tables all retrieve better.

### 6. Cross-references create a navigation graph

The RAG indexer stores `prevChunk`/`nextChunk`/`siblings` metadata. Cross-references between documents let Claude follow chains: `core.md -> coding-rules.md -> database.md`.

### 7. No decorative formatting

ASCII boxes, excessive emoji, rhetorical questions, and motivational text all waste tokens without improving retrieval or comprehension.

## Embedding Pipeline

### Embedding Models

| Model | Quality | Speed | When Used |
|-------|---------|-------|-----------|
| `Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` | High (true semantic) | ~3s for 1000 entries | Primary — `build-embeddings.mjs` uses this |
| `domain-aware-hash-v1` | Good (domain clustering) | <1s for 1000 entries | Fallback when Transformers.js unavailable |

**Neural embeddings (Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2):**
- Uses `@xenova/transformers` with ONNX WASM runtime
- 384-dimensional vectors, L2-normalized
- True semantic understanding — "soft delete" matches "mark as deleted" without keyword overlap
- Loaded lazily on first use, cached for subsequent queries
- Ships with moflo; no additional install needed

**Domain-aware hash embeddings (fallback):**
- Custom SimHash-style algorithm with 12 domain clusters
- Domain clusters group related terms: `database` (orm, postgresql, entity, schema...), `frontend` (react, component, css...), `testing` (vitest, mock, expect...), etc.
- Multi-position hashing with bigram/trigram features
- Good at keyword-level matching but misses semantic paraphrases
- No external dependencies — always available

### The Embedding Alignment Problem

**Critical rule:** Query embeddings MUST match stored embeddings. Computing cosine similarity between vectors from different models produces meaningless scores.

Both the search scripts and the MCP memory tools auto-detect the stored embedding model:

```javascript
// Check what model stored entries predominantly use
const modelCheck = db.prepare(
  `SELECT embedding_model, COUNT(*) as cnt FROM memory_entries
   WHERE status = 'active' AND embedding IS NOT NULL
   GROUP BY embedding_model ORDER BY cnt DESC LIMIT 1`
).get();

// If stored embeddings are neural, use neural for query too
```

Search also **filters out entries with mismatched `embedding_model`** — if the query uses neural embeddings, hash-embedded entries are skipped (and vice versa).

### Domain Cluster Tuning

The hash fallback's domain clusters can be extended with project-specific terms. Add terms to the relevant cluster in the hash embedding function to improve keyword-level matching for your domain:

| Cluster | Example Terms |
|---------|--------------|
| `database` | your ORM, database engine, schema terms |
| `frontend` | UI framework, component library terms |
| `backend` | DI container, API framework terms |
| `testing` | test framework, assertion library terms |
| `security` | auth system, permission model terms |

## RAG Indexing Pipeline

### How `index-guidance.mjs` Works

1. **Scan** configured directories for `.md` files
2. **Hash check** — Skip files whose content hash hasn't changed (unless `--force`)
3. **Store full document** as `doc-{prefix}-{name}` (for complete retrieval)
4. **Chunk on `##` headers** — Each H2 section becomes a separate entry
5. **H3 subsections** become child chunks with parent H2 as context prefix
6. **Force-split** sections over 4000 chars on paragraph boundaries
7. **Build RAG metadata** for every chunk:

| Metadata Field | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| `parentDoc` | Link back to full document |
| `prevChunk` / `nextChunk` | Sequential navigation |
| `siblings` | All chunk keys from same document |
| `hierarchicalParent` / `hierarchicalChildren` | H2->H3 relationships |
| `contextBefore` / `contextAfter` | 20% overlapping text from adjacent chunks |

8. **Prepend context** — Each chunk's searchable content includes overlap from neighbors
9. **Stale cleanup** — After indexing, remove entries for files that no longer exist on disk
10. **Background embedding** — Spawn `build-embeddings.mjs` in background to generate vectors

### Configuring Indexed Directories

In `moflo.yaml`:

```yaml
guidance:
  directories:
    - .claude/guidance
    - docs/guides
```

Default directories (when no config): `.claude/guidance`, `docs/guides`

Moflo also automatically indexes its own bundled guidance from `node_modules/moflo/.claude/guidance/` when installed as a library in a consumer project.

## Lessons Learned

### Document Optimization

1. **`**Purpose:**` lines are critical** — They're the single highest-impact addition for retrieval quality.
2. **Headings are embeddings** — In a chunk-per-section system, the heading IS the embedding's primary signal. Generic headings are nearly useless.
3. **Tables retrieve better than prose** — Claude parses structured data with higher accuracy.
4. **Cross-references are the RAG graph** — Isolated documents can't be navigated.
5. **Chunk size matters** — A 10,000-char section produces a diluted embedding. Splitting into focused sections triples the chance of matching specific queries.

### Embedding Pipeline

6. **Query embeddings MUST match stored embeddings** — This is the single most critical rule. Auto-detect and match.
7. **Domain clusters need project-specific terms** — Generic NLP clusters miss project-specific terminology. Adding terms to domain clusters dramatically improves keyword-level matching.
8. **Filter mismatched entries during search** — Mixed databases need explicit filtering by `embedding_model`.

## Replication Guide

To set up this system in a new project using moflo:

### 1. Install Moflo

```bash
npm install moflo
npx flo init
```

### 2. Create Guidance Documents

Create `.claude/guidance/` directory with markdown files following the optimization rules above:
- Every file has `**Purpose:**` line
- H2 sections with domain keywords in headings
- Tables for structured rules
- Cross-references between related docs
- 1000-4000 char sections

### 3. Configure Indexing

In `moflo.yaml`:

```yaml
guidance:
  directories:
    - .claude/guidance
    - docs/guides

auto_index:
  guidance: true
  code_map: true
```

### 4. Index and Verify

```bash
# Index documents
npx flo-index --force

# Test search quality
npx flo memory search --query "your domain query" --namespace guidance

# Verify from Claude Code via MCP
# mcp__claude-flow__memory_search query="your domain query" namespace="guidance"
```
