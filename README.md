# MoFlo

**An opinionated fork of [Ruflo/Claude Flow](https://github.com/ruvnet/ruflo), optimized for local development.**

MoFlo adds automatic code and guidance cataloging along with memory gating on top of the original Ruflo/Claude Flow orchestration engine. Where the upstream project provides raw building blocks, MoFlo ships opinionated defaults — workflow gates that enforce memory-first patterns, semantic indexing that runs at session start, and learned routing that improves over time — so you get a productive setup from `flo init` without manual tuning.

Install it as a dev dependency and run `flo init`.

## Features

| Feature | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| **Semantic Memory** | 384-dim domain-aware embeddings. Store knowledge, search it instantly. |
| **Code Navigation** | Indexes your codebase structure so Claude can answer "where does X live?" without Glob/Grep. |
| **Guidance Indexing** | Chunks your project docs (`.claude/guidance/`, `docs/`) and makes them searchable. |
| **Workflow Gates** | Enforces memory-first and task-creation patterns via Claude Code hooks. Prevents Claude from skipping steps. |
| **Learned Routing** | Routes tasks to the right agent type. Learns from outcomes — gets better over time. |
| **`/flo` Skill** | Execute GitHub issues through a full workflow: research → enhance → implement → test → simplify → PR. (Also available as `/fl`.) |
| **Context Tracking** | Monitors context window usage (FRESH → MODERATE → DEPLETED → CRITICAL) and advises accordingly. |
| **Cross-Platform** | Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows. |

## Getting Started

### 1. Install and init

```bash
npm install --save-dev moflo
npx flo init
```

`flo init` automatically scans your project to find where your guidance and code live, then writes the results into `moflo.yaml`. It looks for:

| What | Directories it checks | Default if none found |
|------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Guidance** | `.claude/guidance`, `docs/guides`, `docs`, `architecture`, `adr`, `.cursor/rules` | `.claude/guidance` |
| **Source code** | `src`, `packages`, `lib`, `app`, `apps`, `services`, `server`, `client` | `src` |
| **Languages** | Scans detected source dirs for file extensions | `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx` |

It also generates:

| Generated File | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| `moflo.yaml` | Project config with detected guidance/code locations |
| `.claude/settings.json` | Workflow gate hooks for Claude Code |
| `.claude/skills/flo/` | The `/flo` issue execution skill (also `/fl`) |
| `CLAUDE.md` section | Teaches Claude how to use MoFlo |
| `.gitignore` entries | Excludes MoFlo state directories |

In interactive mode (`flo init` without `--yes`), it shows what it found and lets you confirm or adjust before writing.

### 2. Review your guidance and code settings

Open `moflo.yaml` to see what init detected. The two key sections:

**Guidance** — documentation that helps Claude understand your project (conventions, architecture, domain context):

```yaml
guidance:
  directories:
    - .claude/guidance    # project rules, patterns, conventions
    - docs                # general documentation
```

**Code map** — source files to index for "where does X live?" navigation:

```yaml
code_map:
  directories:
    - src                 # your source code
    - packages            # shared packages (monorepo)
  extensions: [".ts", ".tsx"]
  exclude: [node_modules, dist, .next, coverage]
```

MoFlo chunks your guidance files into semantic embeddings and indexes your code structure, so Claude searches your knowledge base before touching any files. Adjust these directories to match your project:

```yaml
# Monorepo with shared docs
guidance:
  directories: [.claude/guidance, docs, packages/shared/docs]
code_map:
  directories: [packages, apps, libs]

# Backend + frontend
code_map:
  directories: [server/src, client/src]
```

### 3. Index and verify

```bash
npx flo memory index-guidance    # Index your guidance docs
npx flo memory code-map          # Index your code structure
npx flo doctor                   # Verify everything works
```

Both indexes run automatically at session start after this, so you only need to run them manually on first setup or after major structural changes.

## Commands

### Memory

```bash
flo memory store -k "key" --value "data"    # Store with 384-dim embedding
flo memory search -q "auth patterns"         # Semantic search
flo memory index-guidance                    # Index guidance docs
flo memory code-map                          # Index code structure
flo memory rebuild-index                     # Regenerate all embeddings
flo memory stats                             # Show statistics
```

### Routing & Learning

```bash
flo hooks route --task "description"          # Route task to optimal agent
flo hooks learn --pattern "..." --domain "."  # Store a pattern
flo hooks patterns                            # List learned patterns
flo hooks consolidate                         # Promote/prune patterns
```

### Workflow Gates

```bash
flo gate check-before-scan       # Blocks Glob/Grep if memory not searched
flo gate check-before-agent      # Blocks Agent tool if no TaskCreate
flo gate prompt-reminder         # Context bracket tracking
flo gate session-reset           # Reset workflow state
```

### Feature Orchestration

Sequence multiple GitHub issues through `/flo` workflows using a YAML definition:

```bash
flo orc run feature.yaml              # Execute a feature (stories in dependency order)
flo orc run feature.yaml --dry-run    # Show execution plan without running
flo orc run feature.yaml --verbose    # Execute with Claude output streaming
flo orc status my-feature             # Check progress of a feature
flo orc reset my-feature              # Reset feature state for re-run
```

Feature YAML example:

```yaml
feature:
  id: my-feature
  name: "My Feature"
  repository: /path/to/project
  base_branch: main

  stories:
    - id: story-1
      name: "Entity and service"
      issue: 101

    - id: story-2
      name: "Routes and tests"
      issue: 102
      depends_on: [story-1]
```

Stories are resolved via topological sort (respecting `depends_on`), then executed sequentially by spawning `claude -p "/flo <issue>"`.

### System

```bash
flo init                          # Initialize project (one-time setup)
flo doctor                       # Health check
flo --version                    # Show version
```


## Full Configuration Reference

`flo init` generates a `moflo.yaml` at your project root. Here's the complete set of options:

```yaml
project:
  name: "my-project"

guidance:
  directories: [.claude/guidance]
  namespace: guidance

code_map:
  directories: [src, packages]
  extensions: [".ts", ".tsx"]
  exclude: [node_modules, dist]
  namespace: code-map

gates:
  memory_first: true                 # Must search memory before file exploration
  task_create_first: true            # Must TaskCreate before Agent tool
  context_tracking: true             # Track context window depletion

auto_index:
  guidance: true                     # Auto-index docs on session start
  code_map: true                     # Auto-index code on session start

hooks:
  pre_edit: true                     # Track file edits for learning
  post_edit: true                    # Record edit outcomes
  pre_task: true                     # Agent routing before task spawn
  post_task: true                    # Record task results for learning
  gate: true                         # Workflow gate enforcement
  route: true                        # Intelligent task routing
  stop_hook: true                    # Session-end persistence
  session_restore: true              # Restore session state on start

models:
  default: opus
  research: sonnet
  review: opus
  test: sonnet

model_routing:
  enabled: false                     # Set to true for automatic model selection
  confidence_threshold: 0.85
  cost_optimization: true
  circuit_breaker: true

status_line:
  enabled: true
  branding: "MoFlo V4"
  mode: compact                      # single-line, compact, or dashboard
  show_dir: true                      # current directory name (compact/dashboard only)
  show_git: true
  show_session: true
  show_swarm: true
  show_agentdb: true
  show_mcp: true
```

### Model Routing

By default, MoFlo uses **static model preferences** — each agent role uses the model specified in `models:`. This is predictable and gives you full control.

Set `model_routing.enabled: true` to enable **intelligent routing**, which analyzes each task's complexity and auto-selects the cheapest capable model:

| Complexity | Model | Example Tasks |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| Low | Haiku | Typos, renames, config changes, formatting |
| Medium | Sonnet | Implement features, write tests, fix bugs |
| High | Opus | Architecture, security audits, complex debugging |

The router learns from outcomes — if a model fails a task, the circuit breaker penalizes it and escalates to a more capable model.

You can pin specific agents even when routing is enabled:

```yaml
model_routing:
  enabled: true
  agent_overrides:
    security-architect: opus     # Never downgrade security work
    researcher: sonnet           # Pin research to sonnet
```

## How It Works

MoFlo sits between Claude Code and your project. It uses Claude Code's native hook system to enforce good habits, store knowledge, and learn from outcomes — so Claude gets better at working in your codebase over time.

### The Gate System

MoFlo installs Claude Code hooks that run on every tool call. Together, these gates create a **feedback loop** that prevents Claude from wasting tokens on blind exploration and ensures it builds on prior knowledge.

**Memory-first gate** — Before Claude can use Glob, Grep, or Read on guidance files, it must first search the memory database. This forces Claude to check what it already knows (or what was learned in prior sessions) before re-exploring from scratch. The gate automatically classifies each prompt — simple directives like "commit" or "yes" skip the gate, while task-oriented prompts like "fix the auth bug" enforce it.

**Task-create gate** — Before Claude can spawn sub-agents via the Task tool, it must call TaskCreate first. This ensures every agent spawn is tracked, preventing runaway agent proliferation and making it possible to review what work was delegated.

**Context tracking** — Each interaction increments a counter. As the conversation grows, MoFlo warns Claude about context depletion (FRESH → MODERATE → DEPLETED → CRITICAL) and advises it to checkpoint progress, compact, or start a fresh session before quality degrades.

**Routing** — On each prompt, MoFlo's route hook analyzes the task and recommends the optimal agent type and model tier (haiku for simple tasks, sonnet for moderate, opus for complex). This saves cost without sacrificing quality.

All gates are configurable via `moflo.yaml` — you can disable any individual hook if it doesn't suit your workflow.

### Intelligent Agent Routing

MoFlo ships with 12 built-in task patterns that map common work to the right agent type:

| Pattern | Keywords | Primary Agent |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| security-task | auth, password, encryption, CVE | security-architect |
| testing-task | test, spec, coverage, e2e | tester |
| database-task | schema, migration, SQL, ORM | architect |
| feature-task | implement, add, create, build | architect → coder |
| bugfix-task | bug, fix, error, crash, debug | coder |
| api-task | endpoint, REST, route, handler | architect → coder |
| ... | | *(12 patterns total)* |

When you route a task (`flo hooks route --task "..."` or via MCP), MoFlo runs semantic similarity against these patterns using HNSW vector search and returns a ranked recommendation with confidence scores.

**The routing gets smarter over time.** Every time a task completes successfully, MoFlo's post-task hook records the outcome — the full task description, which agent handled it, and whether it succeeded. These learned patterns are combined with the built-in seeds on every future route call. Because learned patterns contain rich task descriptions (not just short keywords), they discriminate better as they accumulate.

Routing outcomes are stored in `.claude-flow/routing-outcomes.json` and persist across sessions. You can inspect them with `flo hooks patterns` or transfer them between projects with `flo hooks transfer`.

### The Two-Layer Task System

MoFlo doesn't replace your AI client's task system — it wraps it. Your client (Claude Code, Cursor, or any MCP-capable tool) handles spawning agents and running code. MoFlo adds a coordination layer on top that handles memory, routing, and learning.

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  YOUR AI CLIENT (Execution Layer)                │
│  Spawns agents, runs code, streams output        │
│  TaskCreate → Agent → TaskUpdate → results       │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  MOFLO (Knowledge Layer)                         │
│  Routes tasks, gates agent spawns, stores        │
│  patterns, learns from outcomes                  │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Here's how a typical task flows through both layers:

1. **MoFlo routes** — Before work starts, MoFlo analyzes the prompt and recommends an agent type and model tier via hook or MCP tool.
2. **MoFlo gates** — Before an agent can spawn, MoFlo verifies that memory was searched and a task was registered. This prevents blind exploration.
3. **Your client executes** — The actual agent runs through your client's native task system. MoFlo doesn't manage the agent — your client handles execution, output, and completion.
4. **MoFlo learns** — After the agent finishes, MoFlo records what worked (or didn't) in its memory database. Successful patterns feed into future routing.

The key insight: **your client handles execution, MoFlo handles knowledge.** Your client is good at spawning agents and running code. MoFlo is good at remembering what happened, routing to the right agent, and ensuring prior knowledge is checked before exploring from scratch.

For complex work, MoFlo structures tasks into waves — a research wave discovers context, then an implementation wave acts on it — with dependencies tracked through both the client's task system and MoFlo's coordination layer. The full integration pattern is documented in `.claude/guidance/task-swarm-integration.md`.

The `/flo` skill ties both systems together for GitHub issues — driving a full workflow (research → enhance → implement → test → simplify → PR) with your client's agents for execution and MoFlo's memory for continuity.

### Memory & Knowledge Storage

MoFlo uses a SQLite database (via sql.js/WASM — no native deps) to store three types of knowledge:

| Namespace | What's Stored | How It Gets There |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| `guidance` | Chunked project docs (`.claude/guidance/`, `docs/`) with 384-dim embeddings | `flo-index` on session start |
| `code-map` | Structural index of source files (exports, classes, functions) | `flo-codemap` on session start |
| `patterns` | Learned patterns from successful task outcomes | Post-task hooks after agent work |

**Semantic search** uses cosine similarity on neural embeddings (MiniLM-L6-v2, 384 dimensions). When Claude searches memory, it gets the most relevant chunks ranked by semantic similarity — not keyword matching.

**Session start indexing** — Three background processes run on every session start: the guidance indexer, the code map generator, and the learning service. All three are incremental (unchanged files are skipped) and run in parallel so they don't block the session.

**Cross-session persistence** — Everything stored in the database survives across sessions. Patterns learned on Monday are available on Friday. The stop hook exports session metrics, and the session-restore hook loads prior state.

### For Claude

When `flo init` runs, it appends a workflow section to your CLAUDE.md that teaches Claude:
- Always search memory before Glob/Grep/Read (enforced by gates)
- Use `mcp__claude-flow__memory_search` for knowledge retrieval
- Use `/flo <issue>` (or `/fl`) for issue execution
- Store learnings after task completion

## Architecture

- **7 standalone bin scripts** shipped with npm: `flo-search`, `flo-embeddings`, `flo-index`, `flo-codemap`, `flo-learn`, `flo-setup`, plus the main `flo` CLI
- **Project config system**: `moflo.yaml` for per-project settings
- **One-stop init**: `flo init` generates everything needed for OOTB operation
