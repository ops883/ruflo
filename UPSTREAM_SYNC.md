## Applied Changes (this session)

### From hook-handler.cjs (#1342 fix + clean exit)
- Removed argv fallback that caused shell glob junk files
- Added `process.exit(0)` in finally block for clean hook exit

### From intelligence.cjs (#1377)
- Fixed `parentPath` vs `path` for Node.js compatibility
- Support both flat array and `{ entries: [...] }` formats
- Read `metadata.sourceFile` as fallback

### From auto-memory-hook.mjs
- Suppress unhandled rejection warnings from dynamic import failures
- Added `process.exit(0)` for clean hook exit

### From ruvector WASM integration (#1374) — partial
- Added `@ruvector/learning-wasm` as a direct dependency (was missing, blocking MicroLoRA)
- SONA and EWC++ were already wired in via `agentic-flow` → `@ruvector/sona`
- Did NOT adopt the multi-provider embedding abstraction — our simplified pipeline (Transformers.js direct) works with same precision
